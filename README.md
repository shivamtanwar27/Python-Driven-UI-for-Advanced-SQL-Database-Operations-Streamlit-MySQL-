# Python-Driven UI for Advanced SQL Database Operations (Streamlit + MySQL)

  
A web-based Streamlit app that exposes advanced MySQL DB operations to non-technical users. View/filter records, run stored procedures, insert/update records via forms, and generate reports — all without writing SQL. 

---

##  Project Overview
Many stakeholders need to interact with relational data but don’t know SQL. This project demonstrates how to:

- Design a normalized MySQL schema for common business data (products, orders, inventory etc.).  
- Create stored procedures, views and functions to encapsulate business logic at the DB layer.  
- Build a Streamlit frontend that calls those procedures and displays results in user-friendly tables and charts.  
- Provide role-based interactions (view-only vs. write operations) and export/reporting features.

##  Key Features
- **View & filter tables** (search, sort, pagination).  
- **Run stored procedures** with parameterized inputs (e.g., mark order as received, compute monthly revenue).  
- **Add / update records** through user-friendly forms (with basic validation).  
- **Pre-built reports** (monthly revenue, top-selling products, department summaries).
